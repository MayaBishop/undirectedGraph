This is a undirected graph class which I made to represent a graph that stores information related to itâ€™s vertexes and edges as well as contains functionality to edit the graph and find the shortest weight between two vertexes.
I also made a series of test cases for the project which can be found under the tests folder.  
+ The *.in files are the input for the test and the *.out files are what the output should be to compare against.  
  
In order to run the program once you have pulled the git repo do the following.  
+ In the Code directory run the `make` command.  
+ Then run `./undirectedGraphdriver` to run the program. You can add `< ../tests/test{number of case}.in` to test a specific case I made.  
+ To clean up the directory run `make clean`.  
More info about the classes and structure can be found in the Info pdf.
